### Hi there 👋

I am a **Digital Marketer and Developer** based in South Africa 🇿🇦.

I work at the intersection of marketing strategy and technical execution. My primary focus is helping businesses navigate the transition from **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** to **AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)**.

While traditional marketers rely on manual tools, I write **Python scripts and utilize APIs** to automate workflows and structure data so that AI models (like ChatGPT and Gemini) can understand and rank my clients' content.

- 🔭 **Current Focus:** Building custom scripts to analyze and optimize content for the AI-search era.
- 💡 **Core Philosophy:** Marketing strategies need code to scale. I build the technical infrastructure to support AEO.

### 🛠 Tools & Stack

**Marketing Engineering:**
* **AEO Strategy:** Optimizing content structures for Large Language Models (LLMs).
* **API Integration:** Connecting AI endpoints directly to workflows to automate analysis and content logic.
* **Python Scripting:** Writing custom logic to handle data processing and automation tasks that off-the-shelf tools can't handle.

### 🚀 Projects & Experiments

**Lead Generation Automation (Internal Tool)**
* *The Challenge:* Manual searching for leads is inefficient.
* *The Solution:* Created a custom Python tool that automates interaction with practice finder directories to identify opportunities in specific regions.
* *Status:* Private tool used for internal workflow optimization.

**AEO Transition Experiments**
* Researching how distinct data structures impact visibility in AI-generated answers versus traditional search engine results pages (SERPs).
